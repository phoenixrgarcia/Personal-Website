            <p>I am a Software Engineering undergraduate with a minor in 'Software Development 
                for the Mining Industry' seeking a summer internship for 2024. 
                I have a particular interest in Data Engineering, Autonomous Systems, and Software Security. 
                I'm looking to explore the software industry and see where my skills can be applied.</p>
                <br>
            <p>When I first became a student at the University of Arizona, I chose to study Mining Engineering with a minor in Softawre Engineering. I was 
                enamored with the giant machines that are involved in the mining industry and I wanted to be involved in making and programming them. 
                To me, the mining industry is always on the front line of innovation in automation and robotics.
                This was my plan until I had the opportunity to work as a mining engineering intern. Even though this position was a positive eperience, I came 
                to realize that my plan of study would not let me achieve my goals of developing tools for the mining industry. As of Fall 2023, I'm happy to say 
                I've found the Software Engineering degree to be a good fit for me.</p>
                <br>
            <p>I've spent my time at the Univerisity of Arizona working with Dr. Nathalie Risso in the Mine Automation and Autonomous Systems Laboratory.
                Here, I've worked to develop educational material for mining undergraduates on how to program drones for use in the mining industry. This coming semester 
                I will be working to create a simulation of a mineral processing operation to give these undergraduates experience in making operational decisions
                in mineral processing and exposure to the uses of data infrastructure in the mining industry.

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <h3>Undergraduate Research, Mine Automation and Autonomous Systems Laboratory</h3>
            <p>In the MAAS lab, my purpose is both to develop technologies for the mining industry and to progress my education in software and mining. In the spring of 2023, I worked to create educational materials on UGV and drones for undergraduate mining engineers. In the fall of 2023, I will work on two projects. First, I will use IDEAS by Andritz to create a digital twin of a mineral processing plant for the UArizona simulation control room. Second, I will use machine learning to identify PPE in mining pictures. 
                <br><br>•	Recorded 9 videos of drone tutorials. Topics included: set-up, programming, an open-ended question, and a solution. 
                <br>•	Programmed a drone to fly a routine, fly with keyboard control, and track a face using python and the OpenCV library.
                </p>
            <h3>Metallurgical Engineer Intern, Nevada Gold Mines</h3>
            <p>My summer as a metallurgical intern was split between my intern project and side projects. My main project was conducting a roaster oxygen flow trial. I’d sample ore, process the ore in the metallurgical lab, and analyze the results. Based on my data, I suggested reducing the oxygen flow to the roaster to increase gold recovery. On the side, I worked to optimize daily and weekly reporting excel sheets. I changed SQL queries from static to dynamic, I coded a function in VBS to create charts with daily updating axis, and I wrote SQL queries to import data that was previously hand entered. 
                <br><br>•	Intern project voted to be top 20 intern projects of 90 interns, and top 5 of metallurgical interns. 
                <br>•	Discovered a trend between residue arsenic and residue gold that suggests lower oxygen flow rates will increase recoveries. 
                <br>•	Reduce data refresh time of reports from ~10 minutes to ~1 minute. Saved my boss’s time and patience. 
                </p>
            <h3>Math Tutor, University of Arizona</h3>
            <p>•	Tutored students in both one-on-one and group environment on Algebra and Calculus concepts to supplement lectures. 
                <br>•	Coordinated with other tutors to ensure the best experience for the students.

            <h3>GUI for Scholarship Management Service</h3>
            <div class="container"><video width="640" height="360" controls>
                <source src="Assets\GUIDemo.mp4" type="video/mp4">

            </div>
            <p>My team was tasked with deriving the software requirements for and implementing a subsystem of a mock 'Univeristy of Arizona Scholarship Application Management System' (UASAMS).
                First, we captured the whole system in a series of diagrams and derived requirements for various subsystems of the UASAMS. 
                We used <span class="highlight">Jama</span> to keep track of our requirements through this process</p>
            <p>My team members and I chose to develop the Front-End GUI for the UASAMS. We used tools for <span class="highlight">Java</span> including <span class="highlight">JavaFX</span>, <span class="highlight">Scene Builder</span>, and <span class="highlight">GitHub</span>
            to complete the project. I personally created the GUIs for four of our user types, with a focus on meeting the different requirements established in our elicitation.
            In writing this project I learned how to use <span class="highlight">anonymous inner classes</span>, <span class="highlight">singletons</span>, and <span class="highlight">lambda expressions</span>.</p>

            <h3>'Good Cities' Relational Database</h3>
            <div class="container">
                    <img src="Assets\schema.PNG" alt="A picture of a relational database that connects city walkability data to climate data to evaluate the desirability of a city." width="80%">
            </div>
            <p>I'm unsure of what city I'd like to move to when I graduate, but I know that I want a walkable city thats colder and wetter than Tucson. This motivated me to 
                create a relational database that would let me query different climate and walkability metrics to return different locations in the US. In a jupyter notebook 
                I developed an <span class="highlight">ETL</span> pipeline to extract data from the Smart Location Database and the NCEI Climate Database. </p>
            <p>I explored this data, and cleaned out rows and columns that would not be in the scope of my RDB. Then, I transformed the data to fit together through zipcode databases from the United States Postal Service.
                Then, I uploaded this RDB to <span class="highlight">Amazon Web Services</span> and ran some test queries.</p>
            <p>This project taught me about using python's <span class="highlight">pandas</span> for handling large amounts of data, how to work with <span class="highlight">AWS</span>, and <span class="highlight">relational database design</span>.</p>
            <p>You can check out the jupyter notebook here: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CxJRv0oJCxetP5FZphdCOTXRBBL-WF4S?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Link</a> </p>
            
            <h3>Personal Website</h3>
            <div class="container">
                <img src="Assets\website.PNG" alt="A picture of a relational database that connects city walkability data to climate data to evaluate the desirability of a city." width="80%">
            </div>
            <p>Big surprise! This website is also one of my personal projects.</p>
            <p>Since I'm a newcomer to Software Engineering, I wanted to really set myself apart by creating a professional website for myself. This project is a work to develop my <span class="highlight">professional communication skills</span>, my <span class="highlight">web development skills</span>, and my <span class="highlight">self motivation</span>.</p>
            <p>I've really enjoyed putting this together, and have plans to add new features such as: information that pops up when hovering over key words, a games section, and more javascript. </p>
